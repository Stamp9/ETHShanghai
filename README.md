It is a protocol allowing newly issued tokens to carry OPML files in raw data and issuers can syndicate content through web syndication protocol(RSS/ATOM/…) to specified users.

Ethereum users who hold OPML NFTs can simply log in with Ethereum accounts and retrieve the content through the feeds.

Three approaches are available to subscribe feed when users hold specific OPML NFTs:

- Get feeds or subscription lists directly
- Add feeds through social relations’ OPML NFTs(Using KNN3 to query the rss3 social relationship of an address)
- Holding token in specific feeds graph (Feeds graph is the container of the relationship between OPML NFTs and specific contracts(ERC-20, NFT, DAO members). Users can get subscription lists from a feed graph without owning an OPML NFT.)
